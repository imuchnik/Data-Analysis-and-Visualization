The D3 code used in these sample works borrows extensively from bl.ocks.org (a D3 script gallery), specifically from the 
works of Mike Bostock and Jens Grubert. Code was modified where necessary to accommodate and illustrate the chosen dataset.
Changes were also made to clarify and enhance the aesthetic elements of the charts.
The D3 code herein is NOT original; rather, it is demonstrative of my ability to comfortably navigate the JavaScript and D3
technologies and adapt the provided designs and solutions to a new problem.
